### Project 5: Data Analysis and Storytelling with R using WorldBank Economic dataset
- Many people believe that Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing contribute a big part to the world’s economy (Gapminder, 2021). 
- Vietnam, one of the countries in the lower-middle-income group, has a lot of advantages about natural resources for Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing development. The amount of Agriculture and Fishing goods exports increased over the years and the labor force working in Agriculture in Vietnam is more significant than any economic activity. 
- The target of Vietnam is reaching the high-income group by the year 2045 (World Bank, 2020). 
- Whether Vietnam should treat Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing as the spearhead of the economy to reach the target make a controversy among community. It is not enough to evaluate sufficiently situation and direction if only look into Vietnam’s strength and what Vietnam has in history. 
- This project aims to clarify the above problem by analyzing data from the World Bank
- Now, let's get started [Data Storytelling with R](https://github.com/TanThienNguyenVN/Project5_R_DataAnalysis_WorldEconomicSector/blob/main/TanThienNguyen_DataStorytelling_WorldEconomicSector.html)
